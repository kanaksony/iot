## ðŸ“‘ Introduction 
This repository contains resources related to Internet Of Things (IoT). The idea behind creating this repositpry is to make a list of my learnings which I did during my One Year Post Graduate Certification Programme in Internet of Things from BITS, Pilani. Ands, also spread the knowledge I gained and will be gaining in this field, so that others looking towards educating themselves in this area can get benefits out of it

There are several components of IoT as listed:
1. Sensors and Actuators: These are the devices that collect data from the physical world and/or act on it. Sensors measure various physical quantities (such as temperature, humidity, or pressure) and convert them into electrical signals that can be processed by other devices. Actuators, on the other hand, are devices that can execute a physical action based on a command or signal (such as opening a valve or turning on a motor).

2. Network Connectivity: IoT devices need to be connected to a network in order to communicate with each other and exchange data. This can be done using a variety of technologies, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, or even satellite.

3. Data Storage and Processing: In order to make sense of the data collected by IoT sensors, it needs to be stored and processed in some way. This can be done using cloud-based services, on-premises servers, or even edge devices (such as a local gateway).

4. User Interfaces: In order for users to interact with IoT devices and systems, there needs to be some kind of interface. This can be a simple physical button, a touchscreen display, or even a voice-based interface using a virtual assistant.

5. Security: Ensuring the security of IoT systems is essential, as they often deal with sensitive data and control critical infrastructure. This can involve measures such as encryption, authentication, and secure communication protocols.
